## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

This was the most challenging site that I had completed so far. I had used all 3 of basic HTML, CSS and entry level JS to create a responsive FAQ card. The most challenging aspect that I found was the making the highlighted answer open while the others remain closed. I also found it challenging initially that the answers would not open. It turned out that I had placed onclick="toggleAnswer(this) to the question element rather than the container-question element.

I had learnt the 'this' property is a reference to the object and it can be used to literally call the property that I am using it for. 

### Continued development

Continue practicing making the webpage respond to mobile devices a lot better.
